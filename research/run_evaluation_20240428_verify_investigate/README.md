See the `check-harness.jsonl` content, the empty diff is tested here.

It should look like:
`diff --git a/new.txt b/new.txt\nnew file mode 100644\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/new.txt\n@@ -0,0 +1 @@\n+new\n`

I.e.
```
diff --git a/new.txt b/new.txt
new file mode 100644
--- /dev/null
+++ b/new.txt
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+new
```
